For instance West Waterford has pretty decent rural link that actually runs regularly. And if you were placed in Dungarvan there are a few places you can cycle to safely and easily. The town itself is small enough to get around easily if you walk/cycle. There's also very decent connectivity to cork and waterford cities. I know a few car free people in dungarvan, but if you are looking to settle in a purely rural area it gets more difficult. Roads aren't very safe for walking and cycling and you may be very far from a bus stop.\\n\\nCarlow town has a train to Dublin and good enough links to kilkenny. The town also has two internal bus services. I don't know what the surrounding rural infrastructure is like.\\n\\nParts of wexford have good links to Dublin with bus and a decent enough rail service, though the latter isn't near regular enough and a bit slow. The larger towns are easy enough to walk around. But connectivity to smaller towns can be hit and miss. Local links tend to run limited hours and despite several villages being  close to each other (10 to 20 minute cycles in some cases) there's very little in the way of safe walking or cycling stuff. However a few places have GoCar which is great for the odd car hire need. Wexford town is fairly large with lots of services. But beware that a number of towns in the county have grown a lot and services such as doctors are difficult to get into. \\n\\nI'm in a regional town and we use our car 2 or so times a week due to not having childcare nearby or on a bus route. But outside of that we mainly walk or cycle for small jobs, take public transport for longer journeys, use supermarket deliveries for big shops, hire a van for any large items we need moving. But we need the car for local day trips as the bus network to small villages is poor and the cycling outside of the town is crazy dangerous. \\n\\nSo my tips are:\\n\\n• map out your needs (social,work,services)\\n• focus on living in a town not in the countryside\\n• check local link for routes to nearby towns and villages\\n• check bus eireann and other providers for links to cities and larger towns\\n• get on local Facebook pages to see what services are actually available- doctors, childcare if you need it\",\n",

He’s removed the VAT &amp; requirement for planning permission on solar panels for domestic properties which is a positive sign for lowering the costs of the retrofitting homes.\\n\\nHe’s published a comprehensive National Retrofit Plan and is now going to back it up with a Low Interest Loan Scheme which will be critical to even getting close to our ambitious retrofitting targets.\\n\\nOn transport, we’ve an unbelievable amount of money spent on active travel schemes right across the country. We’ve seen the rollout of the Local Link services connecting villages &amp; towns that never ever would’ve been connected. We’ve seen Metrolink, Dart + schemes go into the planning system. We’ve seen the publishing of an ambitious All-Ireland rail plan, progress on the Cork Luas project, commencement works on the Foynes-Limerick rail line, progress on BusConnects in Dublin &amp; regional cities. The planning system is frustratingly slow &amp; reform is badly needed which has to come from the Dept of Housing, Planning &amp; Local Government + Dept of Reform which are FF &amp; FG ministries respectively.\\n\\nWe’ve significant increases in the budget for NPWS, by a green minister (M.N) at the helm &amp; responsible. Badly needed reform to the forestry sector also came from the Greens.\\n\\nHe’s also played a massive role in the Global Loss and Damage Fund  - Varadkar is at COP28 committing to us to it now. ER created the €3 billion find for Nature and Climate Actions as outlined in the last budget.\\n\\nMy issue with the Greens doesnt revolve around ENV policies; they’ve done well on them. They have failed imo on other matters by supporting FFG policies such as lifting the eviction ban etc. but that’s my views. Regarding climate and environment, I do think there’s always more that can be done &amp; we need to everything in our power to increase efforts. I think if the Greens were in power with other left wing parties willing to spend big on public projects we’d see much more climate and environmental oriented actions take place.',\n",

We’ve seen the rollout of the Local Link services connecting villages &amp;amp; towns that never ever would’ve been connected. We’ve seen Metrolink, Dart + schemes go into the planning system. We’ve seen the publishing of an ambitious All-Ireland rail plan, progress on the Cork Luas project, commencement works on the Foynes-Limerick rail line, progress on BusConnects in Dublin &amp;amp; regional cities. The planning system is frustratingly slow &amp;amp; reform is badly needed which has to come from the Dept of Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government + Dept of Reform which are FF &amp;amp; FG ministries respectively.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We’ve significant increases in the budget for NPWS, by a green minister (M.N) at the helm &amp;amp; responsible. Badly needed reform to the forestry sector also came from the Greens.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He’s also played a massive role in the Global Loss and Damage Fund  - Varadkar is at COP28 committing to us to it now. ER created the €3 billion find for Nature and Climate Actions as outlined in the last budget.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My issue with the Greens doesnt revolve around ENV policies; they’ve done well on them. They have failed imo on other matters by supporting FFG policies such as lifting the eviction ban etc. but that’s my views. Regarding climate and environment, I do think there’s always more that can be done &amp;amp; we need to everything in our power to increase efforts. I think if the Greens were in power with other left wing parties willing to spend big on public projects we’d see much more climate and environmental oriented actions take place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;',\n",

       "   'body': 'Sounds like a great Itinerary. My family and I were in Ireland for 17 days in July/August 2023. We self-drove as well. I love to drive and I made a point to avoid motor ways so we spent a lot of time on small windy country roads. It was awesome.\\n\\nEven if you are driving the motor ways and \"larger\" roads from big city to big city, the fun things to see are going to be via smaller lanes and country roads (read: single track roads barely wide enough for your car). Get the smallest car you can fit yourselves and your luggage in. Not the biggest. Also consider the full auto insurance as on some of these narrow roads the hedgerows and blackberry bushes will scratch up against your doors...not good for scratches, but great to stick an arm out and grab fresh berries :)\\n\\nI think I would advise is if Google maps say a trip is going to be X amount of time, ad AT LEAST 25%-30% more time on to that trip. Distances in Ireland are SMALL, drive times are LONG. You might need to pull off the road for an oncoming tour bus or tractor. You might ned to wait for a flock of sheep to cross or just get out the road. You might get begin a group of cyclists for 5-10 miles with no place to pass around them.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT: because July is BUSY in Ireland AND because Ireland is (was?) going through a housing shortage/crisis, BOOK ACCOMMODATIONS AS EARLY AS YOU CAN. I had a VERY hard time finding places to stay - especially affordable ones - as EVERYTHING seemed booked. If you find it hard to book and would like recos on TRADITIONAL Bed &amp; Breakfasts, let me know. I contacted DIRECTLY almost 300 accommodations because Air B&amp;B / [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) / other booking sites either had no availability for my dates/destinations OR the ones they did were far too expensive. The B&amp;Bs we stayed at had amazing hosts and were exactly what you hope to experience when traveling in Ireland.\\n\\nHere is our itinerary for the 17 days we were there. Maybe you can take something useful from it:\\n\\n1. Dublin - St. Stephens Green, Grafton st., Trinity College tour &amp; Book of Kells, walk through Temple Bar area\\n2. Dublin - Dublin Castle, Christ Church, St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral, Dublinia (i recomend the national Arachaeology Museum, but we had kids and they liked Dublinia), Guinness Storehouse, small pub crawl starting at Brazen Head and NOT including Temple Bar (it is a tourist only pub area, find ones that are more \\'local\\')\\n3. Pick up Car, drive through Wicklow Mountains, stop at Glendalough, visit Rock of Cashel and Hoar Abbey, Kinsale (1 night)\\n4. Morning walking tour of Kinsale, visit Charles Fort (name? It is the star fort at Kinsale), Blarney Castle: Kiss stone, explore grounds, Muckross Abbey &amp; House, Kenmare (1 night)\\n5. Early start: small stone circle in Kenmare-&gt;Kilarney National Park-&gt;Torc Waterfall-&gt;Gap of Dunloe (Do NOT skip this. It was easily  in our top 3 things on the trip and it was a gloomy rainy day. I can\\'t imagine how beautiful it is on a clear sunny one) - we drove through the valley, but you can park at Katies Cottage and walk a little/hire a horse and cart. If you do drive through it, be wary that it is SINGLE lane shared with oncoming traffic, cyclists, walkers/hikers, sheep, and horse carts. It\\'s a slow drive with a lot of pull offs to let others pass but was awesome. Next we drove the Ring of Kerry. It was a rainy day so we probably stopped less than we would have otherwise, but it was still awesome and we drove it in a single day, saw a ton, it was DEFINITELY worth it. After we finished the Ring, we drove to Dingle (2 nights). We arrived in dingle around 8:30p and pubs / restaurants had stopped serving dinner or were just about to, so we were advised to get take-away at Reel Dingle Co. (it\\'s a take out fish and chips shop. Glad we did b/c it was the BEST fish &amp; chips we had the entire trip. And the Kerry Burger they serve was amazing - actually one local said it is their deathbed wish meal. We only ate dinner here for the time we were in Dingle - it was so good.\\n6. Dingle - Wander the town and shops in the early a.m. Check out the church and stained glass windows. Walk along the seafront. Get a pick with the Fundie statue. Grab a crepe for breakfast, stop at the grocery store to get a pie or two for a picnic lunch later. Head off to drive around Dingle Peninsula. Depending on stops, this will take you about 4-6 hours and will probably end at the Gallarus Oratory before you head back to DIngle town. Try to be back before 7-7:30 so you can grab a snug or table at a pub to watch the live music session and if you are lucky a live set dancing session. These were fun and we made sure to talk to locals and dancers between sets - they loved explaining the dancing or songs to us. Remember to TALK TO LOCALS whenever you are at pubs. They love to talk and are SUPER warm and friendly.\\n7. Dingle - another early walk around town before driving North to Doolin (or Lahinch).  The drive was non-eventful. You can go one of two ways: Via Limerick (not worth it) or via ferry at Tarbert (i wish we\\'d done this), slightly longer but avoid Limerick Traffic and get views of the coastline while on the ferry. Because we went at a busy time of year, I could only find accommodations in Lahinch (2 nights), but it was a nice small coastal town with an AMAZING bakery. I\\'d recommend staying in Doolin as it has the pier to the Aran Islands, and I really enjoyed Gus O\\'Connors Pub (see below). Since there was still daylight when we arrived in Lahinch, and it was a clear day, we decided to go to the Cliffs of Moher. We were literally the only people there. It was awesome. Go early morning or Late in the day (during visitor center operating hours of course if you plan to park there or visit the visitor center - not worth the time really). We took photos, walked a bit. Then went to Doolin to grab a pint, dinner, and see a trad music session. It was great: an old gnarled fisherman with one leg got up during the music session and started singing old \\'fishing boat songs\\' a little bawdy, very awesome.\\n8. Lahinch/Doolin &amp; Inis Mor: Second day, we took the first ferry from Doolin (9a or 9:30a?) to Inis Mor (I highly recommend visiting Inis Mor over the other two Aran Islands). IMPORTANT: if you or your wife are prone to motion/sea sickness: TAKE MEDICATION to help with the crossing. Luckily we were warned of this and my wife and oldest son took dramamine (i think?) and they were only mildly nauseous. I heard stories of entire decks on other ferries just being full of sick and vomiting passengers. Take your medication if you are prone to sea sickness. Inis Mor was AWESOME. The last ferry off the island is 4:30p - make sure of this or you will be stuck overnight on the island! We rented bikes, but there are vans and horse carts that will take you around the island. Make sure to visit Dun Angus Fort, Seven Churches, St. Cearns Church, MAYBE the Black Fort. I\\'d say walk to the Worm Hole, but you allude that your wife\\'s MS might make that difficult, but we really enjoyed seeing that. MAKE SURE to leave enough time to grab a pint and maybe some food at Joe Watty\\'s pub. THis was a highlight for us. We sat at the bar. There was a local man sitting a few seats dowen from us. I started talking to him, we had a great conversation. A few other locals sat down, we all chatted. They introduced me to Grace the owner. I bought them a round. They got me a farewell flight of whiskies. It was a cherished memory. TALK TO LOCALS AT THE PUBS. They are warm and friendly and LOVE to chat! We made the 4:30 ferry and headed back to Doolin for an ice cream and another pint and dinner at Gus O\\'connor\\'s. The music was again excellent.\\n9. Galway: I could skip Galway and not have any regrets. That being said, we left Lahinch and drove through the Burren (i highly recommend this) past Carron Church and Poulnabrone Dolmen. After the rest of the driving this area looks like another world and is worth the trip trough on the way to Galway. We stayed in Salthill which is a little outside Galway proper, but very close/short car ride in - probably even public transport. Walk the pedestrian streets starting at Eyre Square and ending at Spanish Arch. Pop in to a pub or two for lunch and/or a pint. There is a little street market some days next to St. Nicholas\\' Church. Behind the Church is a small Catholic School that allows car parking after hours or on weekends - very convenient, affordable. After a walk through Galway, since we were staying at a B&amp;B in Salthill we parked along the water and strolled the \"boardwalk?\" along the water and popped into a pub for a pint. It\\'s a nice \\'by the water\" stroll but if you are staying closer to the city center, probably not worth it.',\n",

       "   'body': '28YO Irish here - I’ll be moving to Belgium in March 2024 but I go to Belgium several times a year for the past 8/9 years. \\n\\nI’ll give you my two cents \\n\\nIn my experience I’ve had zero issues with speaking English (in Flanders region). When you head down south to Wallonia it gets a bit trickier. Many find it hard to speak Flemish/ Dutch, let alone English. \\n\\nFlanders however, although Flemish speaking, practically everyone can also speak/ understand French.\\n\\nI would definitely suggest looking for a job within an international company given the language (that’s what I did). Highest chances of finding that would be Brussels. Although Antwerp does have its fair share of International companies too. \\n\\nGiven you already know some French, use the company/ Brussels to leverage off picking it up a bit more. This will then definitely help you anywhere you go in Belgium.\\n\\nBy nature the Belgian people are very reserved - so finding a friend circle is tough. It’s definitely nothing personal. But once you manage to open them up, they are definitely a cool bunch of people (they won’t fully understand your dry sense of humour) \\n\\nRegarding rental - I am not entirely sure as I will be staying with family for the time-being, but through research it seems much like any other country. Inner city is expensive and smaller indoor space, but less commuting. Outer city is cheaper with larger living space but longer computing. Brussels is generally more expensive than other provinces and Flanders is more expensive than Wallonia. \\n\\nThink of it like Dublin and then the rest of Ireland. Only the housing crisis in Belgium isn’t quite as bad yet…\\n\\nRental prices are not as steep as Ireland mind you. \\n\\nThe public transport is quite reliable and cheap so I would definitely utilise it where you can. \\n\\nHaving a car helps when you want to travel around provinces or even into other bordering countries. This is definitely something I would suggest you try do as it’s a lot more connected than the Emerald Isle. \\n\\nMost importantly - the drink isn’t as expensive either 👌\\n\\nWhatever you do - don’t ask them to try Guinness. They are very proud of their beers (rightly so) and will give you a death stare. \\n\\nBest of luck and if you need anything else/ more specific - send me over a pm and I’ll be happy to give you a few more pointers',\n",

I can\\'t tell you much about the salaries to be honest (they are not amazing compared to other places I have heard, but I left Italy after school), but the big thing to keep in mind is that in Italy North and South are very different. Even different regions are very different. \\n\\nHave been living in the UK for a few years now and to me it honestly feels not much more \"industrialised\" or modern than the area I grew up in to be honest. Actually, ever since I left I realised that in Italy I grew up with an incredible quality of life, good infrastructure (decent houses and roads), close connection to nature, very varied education especially in terms of languages, easy access to other European countries, good public services (honestly, never had a problem with any paperwork in Italy, usually got everything quickly and efficiently and in 3 different languages if requested), amazing food culture and liveable cities, general positive outlook of people, easy access to nature and most of all, affordable public transport that always made it easy to feel very connected to the area around me without needing a car. \\n\\nAs others have mentioned before, it might be worth travelling around a little to get an idea of what each place feels like before you settle down and tie your life into a high paying job. Especially if you want to learn the language it should be fairly easy (in any touristy area or university town) to get a job in hospitality or so to get you started money wise and to sort of immerse yourself in the language a bit more. A lot of places that offer seasonal work also provide accommodation.\\n\\nIt really depends what you are after, but if not big city life, I would recommend maybe to look at cities like Trento, Verona or Bologna for a start? Bolzano if you happen to know any German. Milan of course worth considering too, but it doesn\\'t feel like your typical Italian city.\\nBut to be honest, Italy is a very easy country to love and have some really nice times in. There is lots of work in tourism and hospitality even if you don\\'t know the language.\\n\\nOther than that, the other cities that have a big place in my heart personally are Innsbruck and Vienna in Austria. Both stunning.\\n\\nAnd, if it only was a little more affordable; Dublin; Irish people are some of the nicest you will ever meet.',\n",

       "   'body': '&gt; The period from 00 to 06 was a massive bull run due to excessive lending and no oversight.\\n\\nNope. For one thing [the Celtic Tiger boom started in the mid-nineties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Tiger. For another, bank lending to property developers wasn\\'t the predominant cause of growth, Ireland\\'s dominant sources of cash in that period were computer companies, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, which fall into the \"chemicals and machines &amp; electronic\" categories in this [World Bank Report](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/IRL/Year/2004/Summarytext)\\n\\n&gt; The oversupply of houses was just an effect of the race to make money on inflated property prices.\\n\\nBy whom? I recall in 2004 Cork hosted a foreign house-buying as an investment expo for local Irish people. Several of the people I went to college with in UCC lived in houses or flats their parents had bought for them as investments (for the parents). The entire Irish population, from top to bottom, was in on it. \\n\\n&gt; I\\'d like to see the numbers post 08 if you have them.\\n\\nWhat numbers? Population numbers are in the link I sent you: did you look at it?\\n\\n&gt; Are you saying that even if we bring in more immigrants our housing supply does not decrease further? \\n\\nWhen we brought in more migrants between 2000 and 2006 our housing supply increased. So migration and housing supply are completely unrelated to one another. \\n\\nThe problem with Ireland is (a) we\\'re not building enough high-quality well-maintained flats and (b) we\\'re not investing in good public transport. \\n\\nIf we brought in a bunch of lads to make a six-line Dublin Metro going to all corners of the M50, we could construct a ton of high-quality housing with easy access to the inner city, without pressurising the economy. \\n\\nLikewise inner city Cork is full of undeveloped semi-derelict buildings that could be renovated tastefully and create a huge variety of flats. Unfortunately property developers are playing chicken with the government, hoping the buildings will collapse before the government forces them to renovate rather than replace them with dismal Soviet flats. Even so, out by the Cork docklands there\\'s tons of land that\\'s been recently developed, is still being developed , and could be developed even further. \\n\\nFrankly the problem is an absence of labour &amp; regulation.\\n\\n&gt; We can\\'t build enough houses to keep up with the demand (purposely by the government to maintain and increase housing prices to owners).\\n\\nI agree with you: the problem is the government being too kind to property developers and owners. \\n\\n&gt; I feel the ignorance is on both sides and this is the problem. No one wants to listen to the village who gets overrun with migrants \\n\\nWhich village got overrun, by what percentage was the population increased, and what was the ill effect, other than people getting used to meeting someone they didn\\'t know from birth for the first time ever.\\n\\nYou talk about ignorance, but all your counter-arguments are incredibly vague: there\\'s no real-world case-studies at a meaningful scale.\\n\\nMost Irish villages I see are either dormitories for commuters, or dying. The ones that boomed were largely caused by native Irish commuters (e.g. all the villages around Kilkenny). Don\\'t forget migration is internal as well as external. Hell, even [official immigration statistics include Irish citizens in their lists of immigrants](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-pme/populationandmigrationestimatesapril2022/keyfindings/)\\n\\n&gt; The population increased by 88,800 persons ... There were 120,700 immigrants ... Of those immigrants; 28,900 were returning Irish nationals, 24,300 were other EU nationals, and 4,500 were UK nationals.',\n",

The entire Irish population, from top to bottom, was in on it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to see the numbers post 08 if you have them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What numbers? Population numbers are in the link I sent you: did you look at it?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Are you saying that even if we bring in more immigrants our housing supply does not decrease further? &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we brought in more migrants between 2000 and 2006 our housing supply increased. So migration and housing supply are completely unrelated to one another. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with Ireland is (a) we&amp;#39;re not building enough high-quality well-maintained flats and (b) we&amp;#39;re not investing in good public transport. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If we brought in a bunch of lads to make a six-line Dublin Metro going to all corners of the M50, we could construct a ton of high-quality housing with easy access to the inner city, without pressurising the economy. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise inner city Cork is full of undeveloped semi-derelict buildings that could be renovated tastefully and create a huge variety of flats. Unfortunately property developers are playing chicken with the government, hoping the buildings will collapse before the government forces them to renovate rather than replace them with dismal Soviet flats. Even so, out by the Cork docklands there&amp;#39;s tons of land that&amp;#39;s been recently developed, is still being developed , and could be developed even further. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly the problem is an absence of labour &amp;amp; regulation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t build enough houses to keep up with the demand (purposely by the government to maintain and increase housing prices to owners).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I agree with you: the problem is the government being too kind to property developers and owners. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;I feel the ignorance is on both sides and this is the problem. No one wants to listen to the village who gets overrun with migrants &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Which village got overrun, by what percentage was the population increased, and what was the ill effect, other than people getting used to meeting someone they didn&amp;#39;t know from birth for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You talk about ignorance, but all your counter-arguments are incredibly vague: there&amp;#39;s no real-world case-studies at a meaningful scale.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Most Irish villages I see are either dormitories for commuters, or dying. The ones that boomed were largely caused by native Irish commuters (e.g. all the villages around Kilkenny). Don&amp;#39;t forget migration is internal as well as external. Hell, even &lt;a href=\"https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-pme/populationandmigrationestimatesapril2022/keyfindings/\"&gt;official immigration statistics include Irish citizens in their lists of immigrants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The population increased by 88,800 persons ... There were 120,700 immigrants ... Of those immigrants; 28,900 were returning Irish nationals, 24,300 were other EU nationals, and 4,500 were UK nationals.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;',\n",
